# 🛠️ Day 5 – OmniDesk  
**Status:** Low energy mode, but still shipped code.

## ✅ What got done today
- 🔒 Added **password hashing** to `models.py` using Werkzeug – no more storing plain-text sins.
- 🧠 Integrated **Flask-Login**:
  - Initialized with `login = LoginManager(app)` in `__init__.py`.
  - Applied `UserMixin` to the `User` model.
  - Implemented the user loader function:
    ```python
    @login.user_loader  
    def load_user(id):  
        return db.session.get(User, int(id))
    ```
  - App now remembers user sessions and supports "remember me" login.
- 🔐 Protected views using `@login_required` decorator.

## 🔜 Next Up (Day 6 Goals)
- 🚦 Finish **redirect logic** after login.
- 👤 Update `index.html` to display the current user (e.g., `Welcome, Clyde`).
- 📝 Implement **user registration** (route + form + DB commit + validation).

---

## 🧠 Note to Self
Even on low energy days, **small commits > no commits**.  
Showing up tired still counts.
